description: |
  bitmexr 0.3.0 brings some new features to the package. The biggest change is the
  package now supports placing, editing and cancelling orders on the exchange.
  In addition the testnet version of the API is no supported. This means you can try out
  managing orders using the package in a risk free environment!
