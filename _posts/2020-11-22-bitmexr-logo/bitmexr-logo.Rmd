```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Hex logos are ubiquitous with R packages, and I had been meaning to create one for my `bitmexr` package for a while. For one reason or another I never quite got round to it, but that changes today! I thought I'd note down the steps I took here for future reference.

A quick google of "how to create R hex logo" pointed me towards the `hexSticker` package, which I promptly installed and set to work. After having a look at some of the examples on https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker, I opted for a really simple design (I was never much of an artist `r emo::ji("laughing")`) using the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(hexSticker)

sticker("/home/harry/Desktop/Bitcoin-Logo.png",
        package="bitmexr",
        p_size=20,
        s_x=1,
        s_y=0.75,
        s_width = 0.9,
        s_height = 0.9,
        h_fill = "#000000",
        h_color = "#f2a900",
        asp = 0.9,
        filename="hex.png")

```

The end result looks like this

```{r fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("hex.png")
```

Not particularly imaginative, but I'm happy with it as a first attempt!
