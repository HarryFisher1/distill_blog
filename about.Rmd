Hi! My name is Harry Fisher. Thanks for visiting my site. I have a passion for data science (especially all things **R**) and wanted to a place to document my learning and share thing I discover along the way.

I currently work at a big data company as a statistical modeller in Cardiff, Wales. Previously, I completed my PhD at Cardiff Metropolitan University in December 2019, investigating risk factors associated with sports injury.

Feel free to get in touch if anything catches your interest!
