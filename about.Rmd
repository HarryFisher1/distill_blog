Hi! My name is Harry Fisher, thanks for visiting my site. I currently work as a data scientist based in Cardiff, Wales. Previously, I completed my PhD at Cardiff Metropolitan University in December 2019, investigating risk factors associated with sports injury. I enjoy using R and try to share interesting things on my blog.

Feel free to get in touch if any of the posts catch your interest!
