Hello! Thanks for visiting my site. I have a passion for Data Science (especially all things **R**) and wanted to a place to document my learning and share thing I discover along the way.

I currently work for LexisNexis Risk Solutions as a statistical modeller in Cardiff, Wales. Before starting at LexisNexis, I completed my PhD at Cardiff Metropolitan University in December 2019.
