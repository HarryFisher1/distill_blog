Hi! My name is Harry Fisher, thanks for visiting my site. I currently work as a research data scientist at [Pharmatelligence](http://www.pharmatelligence.co.uk/our-experts.php) based in Cardiff, Wales. I enjoy using R and recently became a RStudio [certified instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/fisher+harry/). Previously, I completed my [PhD](https://github.com/hfshr/phd-thesis/blob/master/full_phd.pdf) at Cardiff Metropolitan University in December 2019, investigating risk factors associated with sports injury. I enjoy writing about things I'm working on and try to share some interesting things I discover on my blog.

Feel free to get in touch if any of the posts catch your interest!
