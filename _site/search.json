I currently work as a Senior R Engineer at Seven Bridges, developing and maintaining a range of R packages and Shiny applications. Previously, I have worked as a data scientist in the pharmaceutical, and financial crime & compliance sectors.\nI am very enthusiastic about the R programming language, and enjoy trying to solve challenging problems and learning new tricks. I have also recently become a RStudio certified instructor for working with the tidyverse.\nI occasionally write about things I‚Äôm working and hopefully share some interesting things on my blog. Feel free to get in touch if any of the posts catch your interest!\nResearch\nIn a different life, I completed my Ph.D. at Cardiff Metropolitan University where I investigated risk factors associated with sports injury from an interdisciplinary perspective. Below are some research articles that I published along the way.\nFisher et al.¬†2020. An interdisciplinary examination of stress and injury in athletes. [Link]\nFisher et al.¬†2016. Relationship between Force Production during Isometric Squats and Knee Flexion Angles during Landing. Journal of Strength and Conditioning. [pdf]\nContact\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n",
