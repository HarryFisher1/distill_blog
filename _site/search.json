Previously, I have worked as a data scientist in pharmaceutical and financial crime and compliance sectors. I am very enthusiastic about the R programming language, and enjoy trying to solve challenging problems and learning new tricks. I‚Äôve also recently become a RStudio certified instructor for working with the tidyverse. I occasionally write about things I‚Äôm working and hopefully share interesting things on my blog. Feel free to get in touch if any of the posts catch your interest!\nResearch\nIn a different life, I completed my Ph.D. at Cardiff Metropolitan University where I was investigating risk factors associated with sports injury from an interdisciplinary perspective. Below are some research articles that I published along the way.\nFisher et al.¬†2020. An interdisciplinary examination of stress and injury in athletes. [Link]\nFisher et al.¬†2016. Relationship between Force Production during Isometric Squats and Knee Flexion Angles during Landing. Journal of Strength and Conditioning. [pdf]\nContact\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n",
