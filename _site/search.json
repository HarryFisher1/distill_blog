I enjoy using R and recently became a RStudio certified instructor. Previously, I completed my PhD at Cardiff Metropolitan University in December 2019, investigating risk factors associated with sports injury. I enjoy writing about things I‚Äôm working on and try to share some interesting things I discover on my blog.\nFeel free to get in touch if any of the posts catch your interest!\nR packages\nbitmexr: R Client for the BitMEX Exchange \npoweRof10: Tools to scrape data from www.thepowerof10.info \nResearch\nFisher et al.¬†2020.
