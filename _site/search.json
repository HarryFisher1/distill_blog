Previously, I completed my PhD at Cardiff Metropolitan University in December 2019, investigating risk factors associated with sports injury. I enjoy using R and try to share interesting things on my blog.\nFeel free to get in touch if any of the posts catch your interest!\nR packages\nbitmexr: R Client for the BitMEX Exchange \npoweRof10: Tools to scrape data from www.thepowerof10.info \nResearch\nFisher et al. 2020.
